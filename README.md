nexus-pagedecoration-plugin
===========================

This plugin extends the Administration section of the Nexus UI with a menu item "Page Decoration".
The associated page provides 4 text areas where HTML fragments can be added. One for each
extension point:
* Pre Head
* Post Head
* Pre Body
* Post Body

Once the changes have been saved and the Nexus UI page has been reloaded, the fragments will be
rendered into the Nexus UI HTML page.
